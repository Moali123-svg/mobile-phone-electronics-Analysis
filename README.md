There has been tremendous growth in the use of mobile phones worldwide in the last two 
decades. Mobile phone technology has brought the world closer. It provided great convenience 
in communication among people by way of either calling or texting. Now, mobile phones are
coming up with a variety of features like internet access, sending e-mails, games, access
to books and online dictionaries.
By parsing market.kz website, mobile phone advertisement section, I can do research to help 
people choose the favorable phone. It is primarily essential nowadays because many students 
and pupilsâ€™ study remotely at home with a phone or laptop as a result of the pandemic 
Coronavirus. During the pandemic, many families had to buy phones or any gadgets for 
connection to study. For this reason, I analyzed data from site market.kz and compared the 
prices of phones and defined the most frequently viewed models of phones.
After the analysis I provide, parents and students who demand to purchase a cell phone can 
comfortably determine the phone model with the desired price tag. The result of the 
inspection will have a valuable effect on parents or students who prefer the available 
prices.In this project I will make an attempt to answer what mobile phone models are on sale 
with an acceptable price.
The second research question is to investigate the trendy mobile phone series, via counting 
the advertisement viewers. It will be necessary to analyze for those individuals who always 
follow the latest tendencies and will help to buy the fashionable one for themselves.
Web scraping is the process of conducting a special program or script parsing a site. The 
collected data is output in a specified format, such as csv or excel file, according to 
certain rules and algorithms. Data parsing from the site is performed in one of the 
programming languages.
Using web scraping tools, you can extract and collect any open data from sites. These tools 
help you when you need to quickly collect and save any information from the Internet in a 
convenient format. The parser selects new or updated information and saves it in a convenient 
form, providing quick access to it.
